This project predicts house prices based on key features such as area (in sqft), number of bedrooms, and the age of the house.
It uses Linear Regression from scikit-learn to model the relationship between input features and target price.
The dataset is preprocessed using Pandas, and results are visualized with Matplotlib.
This beginner-friendly project demonstrates core ML concepts and real-world application in real estate.
Ideal for learning regression, data handling, and model evaluation in Python.Look this project
